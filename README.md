# BridebookYoutubeChannel
I explored the Bridebook YouTube channel by scrapping data from YouTube with an API key from Google Cloud and performing EDA

We start this project by first creating a YouTube API Key which will be our credential to access YouTube data. I will show you in detail, how to create an API Key. Once the API Key is generated, we will then learn how to use this API key to access different YouTube data. I.e. we will walk through the documentation given by Google to use YouTube API. We will look at the different sections in the documentation to access different data we need to build this project. We will also look at the sample Python code given by Google to call different resources and methods to fetch YouTube data.
